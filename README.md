# The Author, The Wizard And The Sourcecode (TATWATS)

Welcome to **TATWATS**, a next-generation framework for **building, documenting, and deploying modern Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)** using a **documentation-first architecture**.  

TATWATS leverages **AI-assisted writing** to produce a living, educational guide alongside your codebase ‚Äî a **textbook that writes itself**. Using the **PodTracker app** as a canonical example, TATWATS demonstrates how to go from initial architecture to production-ready PWA, while generating **high-quality instructional material in parallel**.

## üß≠ Why TATWATS?

Traditional projects often treat documentation as an afterthought, leaving developers lost in the weeds. TATWATS flips the paradigm:

1. **Documentation-First:** Every module, API, and feature comes with narrative explanation as you develop.  
2. **AI-Assisted Authoring:** The framework generates and maintains `THE_PRIMER.md`, keeping it in sync with your codebase.  
3. **Learning by Example:** PodTracker serves as a full-featured reference demonstrating:  
   - React-based frontend  
   - Node.js + Prisma backend  
   - PostgreSQL database  
   - Dockerized development and deployment  
   - Social features (pods, chat, notifications)  
4. **Educational & Practical:** Every code snippet is actionable, verified, and explained with analogies drawn from **Magic: The Gathering**.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Documentation-First Architecture:** Code and narrative evolve together.  
- **AI-Powered Primer:** `THE_PRIMER.md` automatically updates to reflect project changes.  
- **Step-by-Step Tutorials:** Guides cover setup, development, and deployment.  
- **Progressive Web App Ready:** Offline support, installable, mobile-first.  
- **Social Layer:** Pods, chat, notifications, and user connections modeled and documented.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS + ShadCN  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Prisma ORM  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose  
- **AI Integration:** Generates, maintains, and verifies educational documentation  
- **PWA Features:** Offline caching, installable manifest, service workers
