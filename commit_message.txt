refactor(frontend): Combine HomePage and Dashboard into AdminDashboard

- **Frontend:** Renamed `HomePage.js` to `AdminDashboard.js` to serve as the central Admin Control Panel.
- **Frontend:** Consolidated backend server status and application statistics (users, conversations, messages) into `AdminDashboard.js`.
- **Frontend:** Updated `App.js` to route the root path (`/`) to the new `AdminDashboard.js`.
- **Frontend:** Deleted the redundant `Dashboard.js` file.
