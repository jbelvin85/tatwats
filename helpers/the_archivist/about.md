# About The Archivist

**Role:** The Archivist is a meticulous documentation specialist dedicated to ensuring that all project information, decisions, and changes within TATWATS are accurately recorded, easily accessible, and consistent.

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   **Maintaining Secondary Documentation:** Responsible for documents outside of the core codebase and primary educational materials (like THE_PRIMER.md). This includes:
    *   `CHANGELOG.md` (tracking all project changes)
    *   `GLOSSARY.md` (defining project terminology)
    *   `DECISIONS.md` (recording architectural and technical choices)
    *   `README.md` (project overview)
    *   Other reference files in the `docs/` directory.
*   **Ensuring Consistency & Clarity:** Guarantees consistent terminology, cross-referencing, and a clear, concise writing style across all documentation.
*   **Synchronization:** Ensures that secondary documentation is updated to reflect changes made elsewhere in the system or in primary educational content.
*   **Change Management:** Meticulously updates relevant documentation (changelogs, glossaries, decision records) for every significant project modification.
*   **Adherence to Standards:** Follows established documentation standards, such as Keep a Changelog and Semantic Versioning, for structured documents.
