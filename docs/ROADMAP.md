# 🧩 Preproduction Best Practices for TATWATS (using PodTracker as an example)

Before writing a single line of code, we must prepare the battlefield.  
This **preproduction phase** ensures our goals are clear, our stack is stable, and our project flows smoothly once we begin coding.  

---

## 1. Define the Vision (Your Win Condition)
- **Project Goals:** Why does this app exist?  
- **Target Audience:** Who will use it (competitive vs casual MTG players)?  
- **Scope:** Decide what *not* to build at first (focus on MVP).  
- **Core Use Cases:** Write user stories (e.g., “As a user, I want to create a pod, invite friends, and record a match result”).  

> *MTG Analogy:* Choose your **win condition** before building your deck.

## 2. Outline Core Features (Your Core 60 Cards)
- **Must-have (MVP):**
  - User accounts  
  - Deck management  
  - Pod creation & chat  
  - Game result logging  
- **Nice-to-have (future expansions):**
  - Notifications  
  - Stats & analytics  
  - Tournaments  
  - Integrations with MTG APIs  

> *MTG Analogy:* Every deck has **core spells** and **flex slots**.

## 3. Choose the Tech Stack (Your Mana Base)
- **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS + PWA setup  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Prisma (with Express or similar)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Infrastructure:** Docker for development/production parity  
- **Hosting:** Cloud/VPS/container host (to be decided)  
- **Realtime Support:** Socket.IO / Supabase (for chat & live pods)  

> *MTG Analogy:* The **mana base** must reliably sup

## 4. Administrative & Monitoring UIs (Your Control Panel)
These UIs are crucial for maintaining, monitoring, and understanding the TATWATS framework and the example PodTracker application. They provide the necessary visibility and control for system architects and operators.

-   **System Overview & Health Dashboard:** A high-level view of the entire system's operational status, including overall health indicators, active helper statuses, and key performance metrics (e.g., uptime, error rates).
-   **Helper Management & Configuration:** A dedicated interface to view and modify the operational parameters of each individual helper (e.g., `the_archivist`, `the_author`), including their status, version, and configurable settings.
-   **Message Flow & Communication Monitor:** Visualizations and logs detailing the real-time and historical message exchanges between helpers, particularly through `the_mediator`, to identify bottlenecks or communication failures.
-   **Task & Workflow Monitor:** A page to track the progress and status of various tasks or workflows initiated within the system, showing which helpers are involved and their current state.
-   **Audit Log & Activity Feed:** A comprehensive, searchable log of all significant system events and actions, crucial for security, debugging, and understanding system behavior over time.
